Hi there, my name is Miao Chengshi. Welcome to my homepage. 【[简体中文](https://miaochengshi.github.io/cn/)】

- **Towards Work** 
> I am passionately curious, always willing to grasp new concepts and ideas. I am ambitious and driven. I am collaborative. I am also a natural leader.

- **Towards Life** 
> I love to travel, love to experience new things. I have a pleasant personality and make friends easily.

## My Official Account
I am operating a WeChat official account. Dedicated to knowledge sharing of AI-related skills. 

In early 2020, we were greatly affected by the pandemic. Many schools were unable to open and started online classes. Some schools started using DingTalk for online teaching. However, it was a big challenge for local teachers to use DingTalk to teach online because many of them were not familiar with this software, at that time, there were no in-depth official tutorials. Therefore, I came up with the idea to make tutorials videos on how to use DingTalk for online teaching and online examinations. After two sessions, I got a lot of positive feedback from teachers. Finally, I made ten tutorial videos on how to use DingTalk. After this series was finished, I started making some tutorials on Python programming and writing articles on English listening and English reading.

This official account has become part of my life. On the one hand, this public number can more or less bring some help to others , on the other hand, it also constantly inspires me not to stop learning. Now, my official account mainly contains the following important sections:

- **Python Tuitions**

I post orginal tutorial videos about Python programming. Aiming at guiding beginners to learn Python programming from scrach. In this series, I posted/ will post tuitions about:

> Branching and iteration

> String manipulation

> Guess and check method, approximations method and bisection method

> Functions

> Tuples and lists

> Recursion and dictionaries

> Testing, debugging, exceptions, and assertions

> Object oriented programming 

> Python classes and inheritance

> Program efficiency

> Searching and sorting

- **Data Structure and Algorithms**

In this series, I posted/will post something about data structures and algorithms. I will collect some interesting algorithm problems, and then analyze the solutions and code implementation of each algorithm problem. I will make this process as a video tutorial. Of course, some of the algorithm solutions may be inspired by the solution from web, but I will express them in my own words based on my own understanding. In this series, I posted/will post videos about:

> Algorithms about arrays

> Algorithms about bisection trees

> Algorithms about binary trees 

> Dynamic programming

> Famous algorithms

> Algoriths about graph

> Algoriths about heaps

> Algorithms about linked lists

> Algorithms about recursion

> Algorithms about searching and sorting

> Algorithms about stacks

> Algorithms about strings

> ...

- **Special Planning**

When I come up with content that is interesting or helpful to a lot of people, or a fans suggests something interesting, I'll make a video or article to put in this special planning series.

## My Ambition

I am planning to established a younger empowerment foundation. The foundation is interest-oriented to promote robots, programming and artificial intelligence skills to empower the next yonger generation to thrive in the new technological world.

- **My Action**

> I am sharing basic Python programming skill through online classes to a number of Chinese engineers in Detroit who work in the automotive parts manufacturing and mechanical engineering industries. Together with them, we explored the feasibility of using artificial intelligence to reduce workload and increase productivity. 

> I am teching a Grade 8 student from Indiana via online courses to learn JavaScripts in my part time. I will dynamically adjust the topics of each course according to the student's interests, hoping that by the end of the course, he will be able to use his creativity and imagination to complete a project using the knowledge he has acquired.

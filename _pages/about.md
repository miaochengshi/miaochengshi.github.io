Hi there, my name is Miao Chengshi. Welcome to my homepage. 【[简体中文](https://miaochengshi.github.io/cn/)】

- **Towards Work** 
> I am passionately curious, ambitious and driven, as well as collaborative. I am always willing to grasp new concepts and ideas. I am also a quick learner and anatural leader.

- **Towards Life** 
> I love to travel, love to experience new things. I have a pleasant personality and make friends easily.

## My Official Account
I am operating a WeChat official account. Dedicating to knowledge sharing of **Python programming, algorithms, fintech, data analysis and AI-related skills**. 

> In early 2020, we were greatly affected by the pandemic. Most schools chose to start online classes. Some schools started using DingTalk for online teaching. However, it was a big challenge for local teachers to use DingTalk to teach online, because many of them were not familiar with this software. At that time, there were no in-depth official tutorials. Therefore, I came up with the idea of making videos on DingTalk online teaching and online examinations tutorials. After two sessions, I got many positive feedbacks from teachers. Finally, I made ten tutorial videos on how to use DingTalk. When this series was finished, I started making some tutorials on Python programming, algorithms, financial technology, data analysis and AI-related skills, etc..

**Now I have subscribers from more than 100 cities. The original contents I made have over 50,000 views!!!**

This official account has become part of my life. On the one hand, it can more or less offter some help to people in need. On the other hand, running this official account has constantly inspired me to keep learning. Now, my official account mainly contains the following sections:

- [**Python Tuitions**](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/mp/appmsgalbum?action=getalbum&album_id=1340867406746583041&__biz=MzAxNTg5MDI2Mg==#wechat_redirect)

I mainly post orginal tutorial videos about Python programming. Aiming at guiding beginners to learn Python programming from scratch.

- [**Data Structure and Algorithms**](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/mp/appmsgalbum?action=getalbum&album_id=1469931623889567750&__biz=MzAxNTg5MDI2Mg==#wechat_redirect)

In this series, I mainly post videos about data structure and algorithms. I collect some interesting algorithm problems, and then analyze the solutions as well as Python implementation of each problem.

- [**Algorithm Interviews**](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/mp/appmsgalbum?action=getalbum&album_id=1507824647319388162&__biz=MzAxNTg5MDI2Mg==#wechat_redirect)

In this series, I collect and post algorithm interview problems as well as solutions via orginal articles.

- [**Python and FinTech**](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/mp/appmsgalbum?action=getalbum&album_id=1562820814436106242&__biz=MzAxNTg5MDI2Mg==#wechat_redirect)

In this series, I post some pratical skills about how Python can help us complete some financial data analysis works efficiently.

- [**Special Planning**](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/mp/appmsgalbum?action=getalbum&album_id=1371964478593662978&__biz=MzAxNTg5MDI2Mg==#wechat_redirect)

When I come up with some interesting ideas, or subscribers suggest something valuable, I'll make them as videos or articles. Those kinds of contents will appear in this section.

- [**Think In English**](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/mp/appmsgalbum?action=getalbum&album_id=1589437448407810048&__biz=MzAxNTg5MDI2Mg==#wechat_redirect)

## My Ambition

I shared Python programming skills to some manufacturing engineers and mechanical engineers in Detroit, Michigan, United States. We explored the feasibility of using AI related technologies to reduce workload as well as increasing productivity to those traditional fields.

I am planning to established a youth empowerment foundation. The foundation is interest-oriented and it is aimed to promote robots, programming and artificial intelligence skills to empower the next yonger generation to thrive in the new technological world.

- **My Action**

> I shared Python programming skill through online classes to some engineers in Detroit who work the automotive parts manufacturing and mechanical engineering industries. Together with them, we explored the feasibility of using artificial intelligence to reduce workload and increase productivity. 

> I am teching a Grade 8 student from Indiana via online courses to learn JavaScripts. I determine the topics of each class according to the student's interests, hoping that by the end of the course, he will be able to use his creativity and imagination to complete a project using the knowledge he has acquired.

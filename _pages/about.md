Hi there, my name is Miao Chengshi. Welcome to my homepage. 【[简体中文](https://miaochengshi.github.io/cn/)】

- **Towards Work** 
> I am a quick leaner. I am passionately curious, always willing to grasp new concepts and ideas. I am ambitious and driven. I am collaborative. I am also a natural leader.

- **Towards Life** 
> I love to travel, love to experience new things. I have a pleasant personality and make friends easily.

## My Official Account
I am operating a WeChat official account. Dedicated to knowledge sharing of **Python programming, algorithms, fintech, data analysis and AI-related skills**. 

> In early 2020, we were greatly affected by the pandemic. Many schools were unable to open and started online classes. Some schools started using DingTalk for online teaching. However, it was a big challenge for local teachers to use DingTalk to teach online because many of them were not familiar with this software, at that time, there were no in-depth official tutorials. Therefore, I came up with the idea of making videos on how to use DingTalk for online teaching and online examinations. After two sessions, I got many positive feedbacks from teachers. Finally, I made ten tutorial videos on how to use DingTalk. When this series was finished, I started making some tutorials on Python programming, algorithms, financial technology, data analysis and AI-related skillsand.

**Now I have subscribers from more than 100 cities. The contents I made have over 50,000 views!!!**

This official account has become part of my life. On the one hand, this official account can more or less bring some help to others, on the other hand, it also constantly inspires me not to stop learning. Now, my official account mainly contains the following important sections:

- [**Python Tuitions**](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/mp/appmsgalbum?action=getalbum&album_id=1340867406746583041&__biz=MzAxNTg5MDI2Mg==#wechat_redirect)

I post orginal tutorial videos about Python programming. Aiming at guiding beginners to learn Python programming from scrach.

## My Ambition

I am planning to established a youth empowerment foundation. The foundation is interest-oriented and it is aimed to promote robots, programming and artificial intelligence skills to empower the next yonger generation to thrive in the new technological world.

- **My Action**

> I am sharing Python programming skill through online classes to some engineers in Detroit who work the automotive parts manufacturing and mechanical engineering industries. Together with them, we explored the feasibility of using artificial intelligence to reduce workload and increase productivity. 

> I am teching a Grade 8 student from Indiana via online courses to learn JavaScripts. I will dynamically adjust the topics of each course according to the student's interests, hoping that by the end of the course, he will be able to use his creativity and imagination to complete a project using the knowledge he has acquired.
